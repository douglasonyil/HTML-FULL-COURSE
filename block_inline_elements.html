    <!--
    Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.
    The two most common display values are block and inline.
    BLOCK-LEVEL ELEMENTS
    A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element
    A block-level element always takes up the full width available(strtches out to the left and right as far as it can).
    Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.
    The P and DIV elements are both block elements, and they will always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can)
    -->

    <p style="border: 1px solid black;">Hello World</p>
    <div style="border: 1px solid black;">Hello World</div>

    <!--
    INLINE ELEMENTS
    An inline element does not start on a new line.
    An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary
    This is a <SPAN> element inside a paragragh
    -->
    <p>This is an inline span <span style="border: 1px solid black;">Hello world</span> element inside a paragraph</p>
    <p>The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary</p>

    <!--
    THE <DIV> ELEMENT
    The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
    Th <DIV> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
    When used together with CSS, the <DIV> element can be used to style blocks of content.

    <div style="background-color: black;color: white;padding: 20px;">
