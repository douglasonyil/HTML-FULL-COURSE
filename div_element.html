    ALIGNING <DIV> ELEMENTS SIDE BY SIDE
    When building web pages, you often want to have two or more <DIV> elements side by side
        FLOAT
    The CSS float property was not originally meant to align <DIV> elements side by side, but has been used for this purpose for many years
    The CSS float property is used for positioning and formatting content and allows elements to be positioned horizontally, rather than vertically

    </div>

    <!--
    FLEX
    The CSS Flexbox Layout Module was introduced to make it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.
    To make the CSS flex method work, surround the <DIV> elements with another <DIV> element and gice it the status as a flex container.
    -->

    <!--
    GRID
    The The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.
    Sounds almost the same as flex, but has the ability to define more than one row and position each row individually
    The CSS grid method requires that you surround the <DIV> elements with another <DIV> element and give the status as a grid container, and you must specify the width of each column.
